### Robustness Analysis of London Underground Network

Analysis Tools and Methods: Python, NetworkX, Gephi, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.
Simulation Tools and Methods: NetLogo

## Data
The data used in this project is obtained from the London Underground Network (London Tube) open data platform. The data includes information about the tube lines, stations, and their connections. The data is collected from 2019 to 2022. 

Detatiled Inforomation about the data can be found in the following link: https://crowding.data.tfl.gov.uk/


## Research Questions

1. Is the London underground network vulnerable?
(1) Is there any Small â€“ World Property?
(2) How does it performs under ranfdom attack and target attack?

2. What are the exact impacts when a station is out of service? 
(1) [Network Operation Efficiency] What do the impacts vary different disruption durations and different disruption start times?

(2) [Passenger Travel Demand] 
- What percentage of people in London will be affected, and what percentage will be unable to meet their travel demand?
- What is the overall inconvenience caused by node disruption in terms of travel efficiency?
